Problem Statement
Given n paint-boards, of length {a1, a2, â€¦., an}, and k painters, find the minimum time to paint all the boards,
such that any painter will paint only contiguous sections of paint boards.
It may be assumed that each painter takes 1 unit of time to paint 1 unit of board.

Example 1:
Input:

arr = [55, 8, 33, 12, 48, 9, 1]

k = 2

Output:

96

Explanation:

96 is the minimum time to paint all the boards.

Example 2:
Input:

arr = [72, 82, 31, 9, 99]

k = 3

Output:

113

Constraints:
1 <= |a|,k <= 100000

1 <= a[i] <= 10000
